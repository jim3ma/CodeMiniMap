CodeMiniMap
======

Originally, code from vektah's [CodeGlance](https://github.com/vektah/CodeGlance) or 
Michael Ziminsky (Z)'s [Minimap-for-Jetbrains](https://github.com/mgziminsky/Minimap-for-Jetbrains), Sorry for I could not remember. 
after long time waiting for author's updates and no recently result, I decide to add some functions to CodeGlance by myself.

From first of start, I simply cloned a copy from author's code, and start to dev. So, that is the reason of lacks 
fork info form vektah's [CodeGlance](https://github.com/vektah/CodeGlance) or
Michael Ziminsky (Z)'s [Minimap-for-Jetbrains](https://github.com/mgziminsky/Minimap-for-Jetbrains).

Here, all codes are still open source by BSD license. 

Thanks a lot to vektah's [CodeGlance](https://github.com/vektah/CodeGlance) and 
Michael Ziminsky (Z)'s [Minimap-for-Jetbrains](https://github.com/mgziminsky/Minimap-for-Jetbrains), which are definitely awesome plugins.

Intellij plugin that embeds a code minimap similar to the one found in Sublime/Atom into the editor pane. 
Works with both light and dark themes using your customized colors for syntax highlighting.
